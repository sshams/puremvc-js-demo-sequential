## [PureMVC](http://puremvc.github.com/) [JavaScript](https://github.com/PureMVC/puremvc-js-multicore-framework/wiki) Demo - Sequential
This demo illustrates the use of the AsyncCommand utility to execute a series of commands, some of which must complete asynchronous operations before the next command can be executed. 

The pseudo-classes are written in PureMVC's optional built-in style.

## Status
Production - [Version 1.0](https://github.com/sshams/puremvc-js-demo-sequential/blob/master/VERSION)

## Platforms / Technologies
* [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)

## Features 
Demonstrated are how to...
* Use AsyncCommand utility with PureMVC Framework
* Registers the StartupCommand to prepare the View and ExampleAsyncMacroCommand to register several Asynchronous and Synchronous Commands
* ApplicationMediator upon registration with Facade sends a notification for the MacroCommand to execute.
* MacroCommands waits for the Asynchronous Command to complete before proceeding with the next command via a callback. For Synchronous Commands it simply proceeds with the next.
* Internet Explorer is not supported by this demo. In order to bring you a demo that shows only PureMVC and the DOM with no other interference or abstractions, we decided to support only on W3C compliant browsers.
